# ScoreBoard
Specifically a squash Scoreboard using Adafruit Matrix Portal boards to drive LED panel(s), usually 64x32 or 64x64. Smaller matrices are available.

Code is written in Arduino IDE (currently 2.3.2) - see project_files folder for Arduino files.

Currently, the project uses two font files which are better suited to displaying the project information. 
To use this project directly, copy the two font files to the Adafruit_GFX/Fonts folder otherwise the project will not compile.
